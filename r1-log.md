# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Natlogica

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 2024-01-10-Wed.
I am following a Udemy Python bootcamp course by Angela Yu.

## Log

### R1D1 
Worked on a simple Band Name Generator app, taking user input and concatenating it to print to screen. First time using Replit and Auditorium as interactive coding workspaces. 

### R1D2
Learning about type casting and mathematical operations. Today's project was to create a program to calculate an individual's tip on a meal based on the number of diners and tip percentage.

### R1D3
Learning about flow charts, conditionals and modulo. Also started on logical operators (and, or, not). I learned that you can print ascii art on multiple lines if you start the first line with `print('''` and end the block with `''')`. For the project today, I worked on a choose-your-own-adventure story that made use of lots of if conditionals.

### R1D4
Learning about using the random module and also working with lists. Lists can be nested. Today's project was to implement a textual version of Rock Paper Scissors.

### R1D5
Learning about using a for loop to iterate through a list. Can also iterate through numbers in range(). Today's project was to create a password generator with the desired sequence of numbers, letters and symbols with an end result that is random and unique.

### R1D6
For today's lesson, we visited reeborg.ca, Reeborg's World. This educational site lets you write short scripts to move a robot across a grid. Some of the topics covered today were defining custom functions and using while loops. For today's project, a more complex series of steps to move Reeborg through a maze was required.

### R1D7
The lesson today reviewed concepts with for loops, while loops and conditionals. The project involved implementing an ascii version of the Hangman game, guessing letters in a word and determining if the word is completed.

### R1D8
Learning about functions with parameters. The first argument gets assigned to the first parameter - they are positional parameters. Alternately, you can use keyword arguments instead, making the assignments explicit. For today's project, we created a program that can encode and decode messages using Caesar's Cipher.

### R1D9
Today's lesson is about python dictionaries and nesting. A dictionary stores key-value pairs. In the project today, we built a program that emulates a silent auction.

### R1D10
Using functions with outputs is the topic for today. The 'return' keyword is needed to get output from a function. For example, `output = function()` as a way to store this within a variable. We can use the string.title() method to convert mixed-case entries into title-case entries. Multiple returns can be used within a function to escape if certain criteria are not met. Use triple quotation marks to make multiline comments or create docstrings. Finally, the project today was to create a functioning calculator that could return the result of an addition, subtration, division or multiplication query.

### R1D11
Today's focus is to build a capstone project that incorporates all the concepts we have used so far. The goal is to create a blackjack card game. At the moment, it is a text only game, but it uses the standard mechanics of the card game, working toward (but not exceeding) a sum of 21.

### R1D12
Learning about the scope of variables and namespaces. One important aspect to remember is that it's a bad idea to use global variables. Instead, use a retun within the function to pass that information to the caller, which can then be used at will. Also, remember that breaking a large project down into smaller modules to tackle really makes an intimidating program much more doable. Today's project was to create a number guessing game, allowing the player 5 or 10 guesses to correctly land on a randomly selected number.

### R1D13
Today's focus is on debugging techniques. Describe the problem and test your assumptions. Next try to reproduce the bug. Using print statements can help to clarify the status of a variable, which may be something unexpected and provides a clue to the problem. For the project today, several debugging exercises are provided.

### R1D14
The project today is to implement a python version of the higher lower game, based on search volume: guess which search term is more popular than another. A Python dictionary contains some data about how many followers certain celebrities have, and the game will determine the winning guesses.

### R1D15
Some excitement today because it's time to set up a local dev environment. I've installed Python 3 on Windows and will be trying out Pycharm Community Edition. The project today is to create a virtual coin-operated coffee machine, like one you might find in an office lobby. This project feels interesting to me!

### R1D16
Introducing object-oriented code writing today. For the project, I'm working on converting yesterday's procedural code into a modular structure with objects. 

### R1D17
Going further with object-oriented code, the lesson is on creating a new class from scratch. The project today is building a quiz game.

### R1D18
Learning tuples today. Also working again with the Python Turtle module for graphics. The project is making an artwork with a grid of random dots.

### R1D19
The topic today is using event listeners to pay attention to key presses. There are two projects: one is creating an EtchASketch type drawing program; the second is creating a turtle race with multiple instances of the turtle cursor.

### R1D20
Today's session is entirely devoted to the first half of creating a snake game in python, using the Turtle package. Setting up the movement of the snake involves making three turtles follow one another on the screen.

### R1D21
Learning about class inheritance today and continuing work on the Snake game. We needed to do collision detection on the walls of the screen and print and update the scoreboard. 

### R1D22
Today's project is to recreate the classic video game Pong, using what we've already learned about event listeners and collision detection. 

### R1D23
Turtle Crossing is the name of the video game project I am working on today. It is a simplified version of Frogger, where a turtle has to cross a busy highway. 

### R1D24
Some themes for today are working with the local file system and directories. This is applied to the Snake game for keeping a persistent high score, and also used in a mail-merge type program that will populate names in a form letter.

### R1D25
Working with CSV files and using Pandas to analyze data are the focus of today's projects. One is to create a Squirrel Census app, and the second project is a game using the 50 US states.

### R1D26
More practice using lists and dictionaries, with a project to create a command-line program that converts a word into its corresponding NATO alphabet letters.

### R1D27
Today's lesson involves graphical user interfaces using Tkinter and function arguments. The project for today is a unit converter program that uses these elements in its gui.

### R1D28
A pomodoro app using Tkinter is the project for today. It shows a graphic of a tomato and a clock timer, which is set to stop after 25 minutes to remind the user to take a 5 minute break. After 4 cycles of 20 minutes, the next break is 15 minutes. This is an app that I can really use!

### R1D29
Working with Tkinter, I am building a small graphical app that stores and generates passwords. 

### R1D30
The topic for today is errors, exceptions and saving JSON data. These are used in making some improvements to the projects of the past few days. The password app and Nato alphabet apps are ripe for some upgrades.

### R1D31
Using ktinker to create a flash card app from scratch. It keeps track of words that have been learned so that they are not repeated.

### R1D32
Today's work involves email SMTP and the date time modules. The app is the "Automated Birthday Wisher."

### R1D33
Learning about Application Programming Interfaces in order to create an app that sends an email when the International Space Station is in the viewer's immediate night sky.

### R1D34
Revisiting the Quiz app from before, now giving it a GUI. Using the API URL from Open Trivia Database to retrieve a fresh batch of questions for the app.

### R1D35
Topics today include API keys, authentication, environment variables and sending sms. These are applied to building a Rain Alert app that will automatically send an SMS to our phone when it is going to be a rainy day. 

### R1D36
Today is a stock news monitoring project. To emulate a Bloomberg terminal --- to a certain extent. We can compare the opening stock prices with the closing stock prices. To do this, we'll use an API to get stock prices.

### R1D37
Advanced authentication along with Post, Put and Delete requests to the server is today's topic. This uses the Requests module for Python. The project is a habit tracker that visually shows progress over a year's time, resembling github's grid of active days.

### R1D38
Workout tracking app using python and google sheets. Using NLP, python adds your input to a Google spreadsheet. Using environment variables, auth headers, APIs and Post requests along with DateTime strftime(). Also using Nutritionix API, to get APP_ID and API_KEY. Also openai API and sheety JSON API. 

### R1D39
Today's project is is a flight search app that will contact me with the lowest price on a desired flight. It uses several flight search APIs, google sheets and Twilio.

### R1D40
Expanding on the flight search to include a spreadsheet to sign up new users who want to receive a newsletter about new deals from the Flight Club.

### R1D41
Reviewing how the internet works and some basic HTML. The project involves creating a rating system for movies.

### R1D45
Learning about webscraping with BeautifulSoup to work with html elements. Using this to produce a webpage listing the top 100 movies of all time.

### R1D46
Today's project uses BeautifulSoup to create a Python Time Machine. It asks for input for a date in time, then uses that to scrape the corresponding Billboard Top 100 songs for that date. Then it adds those songs to a Spotify playlist. 

### R1D47
Today's project is a price checker for Amazon which uses BeautifulSoup to scrape a product page and then email new prices when they change.

### R1D48
An introduction to Selenium Webdriver to use in more sophisticated web scraping experiments. Can automate interactions with the browser like clicking and filling in forms. The project involves using this to advance rapidly in the Cookie Clicker browser game.

### R1D49
Today the goal is to combine techniques from Selenium with earlier skills to create a bot that applies for jobs on LinkedIn.

### R1D50
Selenium is used to make a tinder bot that automatically swipes up to 100 times per day.

### R1D51
A Selenium bot launches an internet speed test, then uses that data to populate and publish an automated tweet.
