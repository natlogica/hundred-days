## Log

### R1D1 
Worked on a simple Band Name Generator app, taking user input and concatenating it to print to screen. First time using Replit and Auditorium as interactive coding workspaces. 

### R1D2
Learning about type casting and mathematical operations. Today's project was to create a program to calculate an individual's tip on a meal based on the number of diners and tip percentage.
