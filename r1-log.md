# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Natlogica

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 2024-01-10-Wed.
I am following a Udemy Python bootcamp course by Angela Yu.

## Log

### R1D1 
Worked on a simple Band Name Generator app, taking user input and concatenating it to print to screen. First time using Replit and Auditorium as interactive coding workspaces. 

### R1D2
Learning about type casting and mathematical operations. Today's project was to create a program to calculate an individual's tip on a meal based on the number of diners and tip percentage.

### R1D3
Learning about flow charts, conditionals and modulo. Also started on logical operators (and, or, not). I learned that you can print ascii art on multiple lines if you start the first line with `print('''` and end the block with `''')`. For the project today, I worked on a choose-your-own-adventure story that made use of lots of if conditionals.

### R1D4
Learning about using the random module and also working with lists. Lists can be nested. Today's project was to implement a textual version of Rock Paper Scissors.

### R1D5
Learning about using a for loop to iterate through a list. Can also iterate through numbers in range(). Today's project was to create a password generator with the desired sequence of numbers, letters and symbols with an end result that is random and unique.

### R1D6
For today's lesson, we visited reeborg.ca, Reeborg's World. This educational site lets you write short scripts to move a robot across a grid. Some of the topics covered today were defining custom functions and using while loops. For today's project, a more complex series of steps to move Reeborg through a maze was required.

### R1D7
The lesson today reviewed concepts with for loops, while loops and conditionals. The project involved implementing an ascii version of the Hangman game, guessing letters in a word and determining if the word is completed.

### R1D8
Learning about functions with parameters. The first argument gets assigned to the first parameter - they are positional parameters. Alternately, you can use keyword arguments instead, making the assignments explicit. For today's project, we created a program that can encode and decode messages using Caesar's Cipher.

### R1D9
Today's lesson is about python dictionaries and nesting. A dictionary stores key-value pairs. In the project today, we built a program that emulates a silent auction.

### R1D10
Using functions with outputs is the topic for today. The 'return' keyword is needed to get output from a function. For example, `output = function()` as a way to store this within a variable. We can use the string.title() method to convert mixed-case entries into title-case entries. Multiple returns can be used within a function to escape if certain criteria are not met. Use triple quotation marks to make multiline comments or create docstrings. Finally, the project today was to create a functioning calculator that could return the result of an addition, subtration, division or multiplication query.

### R1D11
Today's focus is to build a capstone project that incorporates all the concepts we have used so far. The goal is to create a blackjack card game. At the moment, it is a text only game, but it uses the standard mechanics of the card game, working toward (but not exceeding) a sum of 21.

### R1D12
Learning about the scope of variables and namespaces. One important aspect to remember is that it's a bad idea to use global variables. Instead, use a retun within the function to pass that information to the caller, which can then be used at will. Also, remember that breaking a large project down into smaller modules to tackle really makes an intimidating program much more doable. Today's project was to create a number guessing game, allowing the player 5 or 10 guesses to correctly land on a randomly selected number.

### R1D13
Today's focus is on debugging techniques. Describe the problem and test your assumptions. Next try to reproduce the bug. Using print statements can help to clarify the status of a variable, which may be something unexpected and provides a clue to the problem. For the project today, several debugging exercises are provided.

### R1D14
The project today is to implement a python version of the higher lower game, based on search volume: guess which search term is more popular than another. A Python dictionary contains some data about how many followers certain celebrities have, and the game will determine the winning guesses.

### R1D15
Some excitement today because it's time to set up a local dev environment. I've installed Python 3 on Windows and will be trying out Pycharm Community Edition. The project today is to create a virtual coin-operated coffee machine, like one you might find in an office lobby. This project feels interesting to me!

### R1D16
Introducing object-oriented code writing today. For the project, I'm working on converting yesterday's procedural code into a modular structure with objects. 

### R1D17
Going further with object-oriented code, the lesson is on creating a new class from scratch. The project today is building a quiz game.

### R1D18
Learning tuples today. Also working again with the Python Turtle module for graphics. The project is making an artwork with a grid of random dots.

### R1D19
The topic today is using event listeners to pay attention to key presses. There are two projects: one is creating an EtchASketch type drawing program; the second is creating a turtle race with multiple instances of the turtle cursor.
