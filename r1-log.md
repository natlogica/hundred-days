# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Natlogica

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 2024-01-10-Wed.
I am following a Udemy Python bootcamp course by Angela Yu.

## Log

### R1D1 
Worked on a simple Band Name Generator app, taking user input and concatenating it to print to screen. First time using Replit and Auditorium as interactive coding workspaces. 

### R1D2
Learning about type casting and mathematical operations. Today's project was to create a program to calculate an individual's tip on a meal based on the number of diners and tip percentage.

### R1D3
Learning about flow charts, conditionals and modulo. Also started on logical operators (and, or, not). I learned that you can print ascii art on multiple lines if you start the first line with `print('''` and end the block with `''')`. For the project today, I worked on a choose-your-own-adventure story that made use of lots of if conditionals.

### R1D4
Learning about using the random module and also working with lists. Lists can be nested. Today's project was to implement a textual version of Rock Paper Scissors.
